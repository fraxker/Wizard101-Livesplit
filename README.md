## Load Time Removal
This script pauses the timer in LiveSplit during loads by reading memory.

## Notes
This load time remover also pauses the timer in the character creation and character select menus.
Also, this will not work until you have triggered at least one loading screen yourself in the current game session.

## Install
1. Download the .asl file found at https://github.com/ItzGray/Wizard101-Livesplit/releases
2. Open livesplit
3. Open the `Edit Layout` menu 
4. Add a `Scriptable Auto Splitter` found under `Control`
5. Open Layout settings
6. Under `Timer`, Change Timing Method to Game Time
7. Under `Scriptable Auto Apliter`, click the checkbox to enable load time removal
